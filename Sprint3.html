  <h1 style="text-align:left;">Perofessional achievements</h1>
  <p>In this sprint the client asked us to make a page for password changing.I was responsible for this part. 
     For the first time I was able to create separate pages for password changing by myself.
 It was a good experience and was also very challenging for me.</p>

 <h1 style="text-align:left;">Technical achievements</h1>
<p>I created a new page for changePassword also I created the changePassword.blade.php for viewing pages
and creating the controller and Route for it. I used branching for my work instead of merging 
all my work to the master branch straight away. This was a good option because I was able to do my work 
without cluttering our master branch.</p>

<h1 style="text-align:left;">Agile achievements</h1>
<p>I tried to be active and support my team because when all members are active and help eachother, it leads to all team members 
  working better and faster which leads to a better outcome. Also my team members were supportive and truste me to get my job done. 
In terms of the scrum, our team always worked together and respected each other. At the start of each sprint
we had sprint planning and at end we had a sprint review with out client. </p>

<h1 style="text-align:left;">Personal Reflection</h1>
<p style="color: navy;"> I did well:</p>
<p>During this sprint I had progress in using laravel. This sprint was a very good one for me since I contributed more and I did my work well.
I knew exactly what our client wanted and I followed the advice he gave me for changing password.
This sprint was also slightly challenging for me due to the use of controller and views. I had lots of problem
during creating ChangePassword but stand up meetings were very helpful because I asked my problems, 
and got a solution. This was a very good experience for me.

  </P>
  <p style="color: navy;"> I could done better:</p>
  <p>I could have done some more reaserching in changing the password instead of continuously asking my team members for help and 
    wasting time.
  </p>
<p style="color: navy;">I learnt:</P> 
<p>I learnt from my previous mistakes and I had a bit more progress with using 
  a laravel. In this sprint I learnt how to create new pages and routes related to them. I was also able to change the layout
  of the page such as buttons to make a better appearancg. </p> 

 <p style="color: navy;">barriers</p>
 <p>In this sprint I didn't have any barriers.</p>
