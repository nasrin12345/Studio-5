  <h1 style="text-align:left;">Perofessional achievements</h1>
  <p> During this sprint I worked with my team member to update laravel to the new version.
   I helped my team member in this case since I had many research about updating laravel. I helped her change some parts of laravel like in composer.json change laracel/framework and etc.
   Another important thing in this Sprint was unit Testing, Which I did for the first time. I did Unit testing
    for Profile page and the result was successful.</p>

<h1 style="text-align:left;">Technical achievements</h1>
<p>During updating Laravel my website got a problem and I couldn't run the website. I used the shareScreen with my teammate to continue updating the website.
  Sharescreen was very helpful because I was able to continue updating laravel until my problem was solved. 
 Finally I fixed my websites problem and could work on unit testing.</p>

 <h1 style="text-align:left;">Agile achievements</h1>
 <p>During this sprint I was not really agile. Maybe just the fact that I helped my team member could be considered agile.</p>
 
 

<h1 style="text-align:left;">Personal Reflection</h1>
<p style="color: navy;"> I did well:</p>
<P>I was good at testing as I had done some research and did some practice testing befor.</p>
  <p style="color: navy;"> I could done better:</p>
  <p>I think I could have been better at time management during this sprint. this could have given me more time to focus on the problem and be able to
    resolve it. 
    <p style="color: navy;">I leart:</P> 
  <p>During this sprint I learnt how to update laravel and how to use the live share when I need it. 
    Also, I learnt how to do unit testing for the project pages.
  </p>

  <p style="color: navy;">barriers</p>
 <p> The barrier of this sprint was that during updating laravel, the calendar was broken and I had to rewrite the calendar code. this was a problem becuase the calendar
  was written with madhatter which was not compatible with the new version of laravel, so when we updated laravel, the calendar page was broken. I tried to find a solution but couldn't
find anything so eventually I asked my other team members and solved the problem. </P>
