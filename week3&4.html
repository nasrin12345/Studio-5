    <p>In this week I downloaded and installed docker on my computer Desktop. After installing it successfully I checked
    the version of ducker by << docker --version >> command and found out my docker version is 19.03.12.
    I ran the hello-world Docker image to test if my installation is working correctly. I used the following command to run my first image,
    << docker run hello-world >> and it ran successfully. I learned how I can remove the container by << docker rm --force bb >>  command. However, I 
    I later understood that if I first stop container by << docker stop >> command, I no longer need to use a --force.</p>
    <p> Also I learnt a few commands for Docker. For instance  << docker ps --all >>  shows all the containers on the machine and << docker image ls >> To check the downloaded image .
     Also I learnt how to create the container and how to remove container.</p>

   <h1 style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; color: firebrick;">Week4</h1>
   <h2 style="text-align:center;">Professional achievements</h2>

   <p> During this week I had two stand up meetings. We shared what we did last week and what we should do this week with the team. Also I continued to work on Docker after setting up my development environment.
    I started developing containerized applications. 
    I downloaded the node-bulletin-board example project. This is a simple bulletin board application written in Node.js.
    I used the Git to clone the example project from github. I also used the visual studio code to 
    open the project and see the Docker files and also figure out how Docker files describe how to assemble a private filesystem for a container. For example 
    workDir is for setting the working directory or Expose 8080 described which port the container is listening.</p>
    
    <p>During this week I built my first image, I used the the following command to craete the 
    image << docker build --tag bulletinboard:1.0 . >> and it's successfully tagged.
    After building my image I ran the command to start the container based on my new image which is 
    bulletinboard:1.0. Also I visited my application at localhost:8000 and saw my bulletin board application up and running.
    I tried to play around with the code of bulletin board application on visual studio to have a better understanding 
    of how to modify the application in docker. At the beginning I had difficulties changing the application 
    but after a while Grayson helped me to solve my problem by the following commands << docker container stop c141c33661c4 && docker container rm c141c33661c4 >>. Using this command I Stopped the container and then removed it.
    Then I ran the following command to build my bulletin board image: << docker build --tag bulletinboard:1.0 .>> 
     After that, I ran the following command to start a container based on my new image which is bulletinboard image << docker run --publish 8000:8080 --detach --name bb bulletinboard:1. >>
     Finally I was able to change my application's Title, and did some more changes in my applicaton.
    Then after making sure my app works successfully, I tried to delete the bulletin board container.  </p>
   
   <p> In this week I tried to set up my <a href="https://hub.docker.com">dockerHub</a> account. First I had some research about Docker Hub
    and how I can create it and how it works. I signed in to docker hub and then I created my Docker ID  
    so I could sign in. I also tried to sign in from command line. After setting up my Docker hub I created the 
    repository with bulletinboard name and I shared my image on Docker Hub, and finally by following command << docker push sabisingh/bulletinboard:1.0 >>I pushed my image in to docker hub.</p>

    <p>At the end of this week I tried to finish my portfolio untill week four. I added some pictures for evidence for each week and I wrote some 
      notes for each week about what I did and what I learnt. Also I had some more practice for docker to have a better understanding on it.

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Conclusion</h1>

    <p>At this point, I've  installed Docker Desktop on my computer.
      I ran a quick test to ensure I've set up docker. I learnt how to use docker and how to create the docker and image.</p>
  <p>In week four I'm able to create the Image successfuly and perform a simple containerization of an application, also I am able to run the application 
  and modify that application.
  Also I learnt about dockerhub and pushing the image in to dockerhub so I can use it in any remote computer.</p>
