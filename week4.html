    <p> During Sprint4 I did made a change in Calendar. The client asked us to make a change to the calendar, so that when you click on it, it connects 
      to the activity page. According to the clients advice I modified the calendar so that when you click on it, it connects to the activity page and after the specific details of the
      activity is given, it will be shown on the calendar.</p>

     <h1 style="text-align:left;">Technical achievements</h1> 
    <p>This sprint was technically challenging as I had had to modify a written code. I was worried to modify the code and break the calendar pages and create problems.
     In this sprint I understood that the calendar was written with madhatter. I was able to become familiar with madhatter.</p>
  
    
    
    <h1 style="text-align:left;">Agile achievements</h1>
   <p> I think that I did a sufficient work in this sprint, 
   and I should have put in similar amount of effort on all the other sprints as well.
    During this sprint our team worked together very well and communicated effectively.
    We encouraged and motivated each other to take on a good workload and also Delivered working features frequently.

    <h1 style="text-align:left;">Personal Reflection</h1>
    <p style="color: navy;"> I did well:</p>
   <p> I was able to complete my allocated tasks before our deadline. Although I was not familiar 
     with madhatter with the help of our team member I was able to do this sprint and deliver 
     my work on time .</p>
     <br><br>

    <p style="color: navy;"> I could done better:</p>

     <p>I took on a  more difficult workload than before. 
    This meant I was going to need to put in more effort and focus onto this sprint. This is because I had to work and modify
    some written codes and I couldn't create a new controller and route for this sprint which was 
    a bit confusing for me.
    </p>
    <p style="color: navy;">I leart:</P> 
    <p>In This sprint I learnt how to edit a written code efficiently and 
    I learnt how to add the features to calendar. I learnt how to connect calendar to the activity pages so when I click 
    on the event in calendar the activity page appears and I can edit or add another activity name which appears on the calendar.
    I also learnt a bit about madhatter but still need to learn more.
    <p style="color: navy;">barriers</p>

    <p>the barrier of this sprint was my lack of understanding of written code and madhatter. At 
  first I was very confused when I saw the code but eventually understood what I should do. </p>
