  <h1 style="text-align:left;">Perofessonal achievements</h1>
  <p>In the first Sprint I had a discussion with my group about project to try to undrestand the user story.
    In my opinion, Understanding user story is very importand because it demonstrates the goal of the project, how to reach these goals and what needs to be completed.
   During this sprint. I was at a beginner stage of learning Laravel so I didn't know much about it. By doing the practical tutorials in moodle, doing reseach and watching youtube videos I was able to get a better understanding of Laravel. During
   this sprint I did some validation and I provided the evidence for it.</p>

<h1 style="text-align:left;">Technical achievements</h1>
<p> During this sprint, I didn't encounter many technical achievements or difficulties.
  For using database, I initially used mamp, but I had 
  difficulty using it so I decided to use local mysql database. I used Laragon 
  which was easier me to use.
</p>

<h1 style="text-align:left;">Agile achievements</h1>
<p>I had a agile since I had teamwork. I think most efficient and effective method of transfering information within the group is face-to-face conversation which is what we did
  during this sprint.Teamwork was very helpful for me because I tried to undrestand lots of stuff from my
  team members. Also, I had stand-up meetings with my team members which is considered to be part of agile. I attended all of the stand-up meetings.
  It was also the first time I met face to face with our client And we all decided to meet the client every friday .</p>

<h1 style="text-align:left;">Personal Reflection</h1>
     <p style="color: navy;"> I did well:</p>
     <p>I did Mood and and snack validation. I did well in pair progrmming and contributed to all meetings .</p>
     <p style="color: navy;"> I could have done better:</p>
    <P> I Think I could have been better at using git and contributing more.</P>
    <p style="color: navy;">I learnt:</P>
    <p> During this sprint, I learnt about how to be Agile during a project and also I became familiar with writing a UserStory and understanding how user story is important.
     I learnt how I can do validation. Also I learnt how to use Git especially in areas such as branching to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository. 
     Another importand thing I learnt is how me and my group members should be working together, and learnt how to be more efficient as a team member for the future.
     I need to improve understanding codes in our project.</p>
     <p style="color: navy;">barriers</p>
     <p>the biggest barrier I faced during this sprint was my poor skils of using laravel and git. This project was my first project and also
     the first time I was using laravel and I need to Improve my confidence to finish this project.</p>
