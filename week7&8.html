  <p> We had two stand up meetings this week with grayson and our group. We explained what we had planned for our networking project within a group. 
    Me and Sabi started our network project; Initially we decided to draw the basic topology and show it to Grayson to check if it was ok before continuing our work.
    After Grayson confirming that it is okay, we put it inCisco packet tracer. Our topology contains two servers, one of them is the main server and the other is a backup server. Our servers 
    were connected to the router via layer-2 switch. We also assigned Admin room cluster, Management room, Staff/common room and added an internet room with one PC for guest internet use.
    Inside each room we put two pcs that could be increased in response to future requirements. We also added a gateway and printer to the admin and management room. Each room connected to the 
    router via its own switch.</p>
    <p>Next we had a discussion again about our project to make our network to decrease the cost as much as possible and make it more scable.
    We added one more room named Sale Cluster to our topology and added two PCs inside the Sales' room. We removed one of the printers which
    increased the cost and one printer remained which was shared between all. We also added one more Pc into Staff/common room.</p>
    <p>I did some resarch about subnetting and vlan. My team mate Sabi made subnetting for our project in his own time, and We had a discussion about it during class.</p> 

    <p>I decided to work on my portfolio. I changed my portfolio's body to make it easy to read, and also tried to change my layout as well to make it look better.
