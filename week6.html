  <h1 style="text-align:left;">Professional achievements</h1>
  <p> In this sprint I did some testing including advanced testing for a target page.
    Since, this was our last sprint, I also reviewed everything to check if it has any problem or error to get fixed before we deliver the whole project.

 <h1 style="text-align:left;">Technical achievements</h1>
  <p>This sprint was a very challenging one for me due to doing advanced testing in target pages. This testing was more advance than the simple
  testing.</p> 

  <h1 style="text-align:left;"> Agile achievements </h1>
 <p>Another agile principle was, working with my team throughout the project until the end of the project. This is an agile according to the The 12 Agile Principles article which 
   mentions developers must work together throughout the project.
  
  In this sprint I attended all of the standup meetings, also attended the last meeting with our client. He was happy as 
  we delivered our project on time and our client approved it.

 <h1 style="text-align:left;">Personal Reflection</h1>
 <p style="color: navy;"> I did well:</p>
 <p>This sprint was my last sprint in this sprint I did very well testing for some pages in our project and 
   I was confident to doing testing by myself. For the final step I reviewed all of the options in the project to make sure all pages 
   work perfectly.</p>

   <p style="color: navy;"> I could done better:</p>
   <p>I spent lot of time to do research for advanced testing. This took my time a lot and I could have done
   more simple testing instead of wasting my time to find a tutorial for advanced testing.</p>

   <p style="color: navy;">I leart:</P> 
   <p>In this sprint I learnt how to do advanced testing for some pages and also learnt for
   the final step of the project that I should test most of the pages to make sure all pages are working correctly
   with no bugs. </p>

   <p style="color: navy;"> I could done better:</p> 
  <p> biggest barrier for me in this sprint was not having enough time and not finding the useful 
   tutorials to do more advanced testing</p>
